# Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to develop a logistic regression model, which can be used to predict whether a loan profile is healthy or high risk.

The model developed for this analysis was trained on loan profile features, which included loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks and total debt.

The loan data was split into training and test data, with 75% of data used for training the model and 25% for testing the model. Additionally, the training data was scaled to improve the model's performance.

A confusion matrix and classification report were genearted to evaluate the performance of the model.



## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

    * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
